# Anki Add-on: Multi-Line Type Answer Box w/ Semantic Diff

An add-on for [Anki Spaced Repetition Software](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) that embeds an input text area for reviewing notes that need typed multi-line answers. Great for remembering certain code concepts, passages of poetry, or any other long-form answer you want to type without prompts. You might use cloze deletion notes to gradually develop mastery, then add a long-form note to test that you can explain a holistic concept that comprises the facts.

This project is a fork of [this repo](https://github.com/robbielaldrich/ankiTypebox) for the [Multi-Line Type Answer Box](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/681236951) add-on, which is no longer maintained. Here's what this add-on contributes:

- Support for Anki v2.1.56.
- Support for content with `\` characters (like regular expressions)
- A consolidated and Anki-familiar semantic difference output (thanks to [this Google-owned project](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch/)) when a card is answered incorrectly:
  - [Comparison when incorrectly answered](#comparison-when-incorrectly-answered)
  - [Comparison when correctly answered](#comparison-when-incorrectly-answered)
- [Coming to the Anki Add-on library soon](#coming-to-the-anki-add-on-library-soon)

## Example `Type Multi-Line` Note

A few long-form notes in your recall practice help you test yourself on complete concepts without the prompts inherent in cloze deletion notes.

### Comparison when incorrectly answered

*Incorrect input text:*

```text
CREATE TABLE users (
  id int GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
  name char(30),
  enabled boolean DEFAULT TRUE
)
```

#### Anki's output when answered incorrectly

![Incorrect Answer, Anki Output](readme/incorrect-answer-anki-output.png)

Notice how Anki's comparison requires looking at *two separate blocks to get the full picture of incorrect vs correct*. That's not too bad when comparing the single lines of text for which Anki's system was designed.

Regardless of how many lines you're comparing, that comparison layout can significantly slow you down.

#### This add-on's output when answered incorrectly

This layout enables a user to focus on what's incorrect, including adjacent ~~incorrect~~correct values to speed up learning.

### Output when correctly answered

*Correct input text:*

```text
CREATE TABLE users (
  id int GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  name char(25),
  enabled boolean DEFAULT TRUE
);
```

## Coming to the Anki Add-on library soon

Because the original add-on is no longer maintained, I intend to publish this as a separate add-on in the near-future, then maintain it as long as I have the time. Until then, you can copy the code here into your local Anki addons folder for local use (the add-on will only be available on the device to which you copy the files). If you'd like to do that:

1. Copy all files in this repository (you can exclude the README.md and `readme` folder) to the associated add-on folder after backing it up.
   1. On MacOS, that's usually here: `/Users/you/Library/Application Support/Anki2/addons21/681236951`.
      1. Create a copy of the current `681236951` folder before copying this repo's files to the original.
      2. If you don't see the Library folder in your home folder (replace `you` above), show hidden items with `Shift + Cmd + .`.
   2. Please search the web to find the addons21 or similar folder on other operating systems.
2. Restart Anki. No need to modify your existing *Type Multi-Line* notes; just enjoy a more reliable and less tedious recall practice! And don't forget to add the notes that previously caused errors!
